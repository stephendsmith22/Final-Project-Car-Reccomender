# Project 3_Car Finder
Our project consists of reading in a csv file of various cars, and their various attributes such as price, year, mileage, make, model, etc.
We then take that CSV file, and sort it based on mileage, year, and make using quicksort and merge sort
The user will be prompted for the make and model of the car, which will be matched to the tuples in our dataset, as well as
max mileage, price, and year. Using those attributes, we will then use that to widdle our dataset down to find the cars that fit those specifications.
By using merge sort and quick sort, we we're able to compare run times to see how each sorting algorithm would fare time wise when sorting elements based on the parameter mileage, year, and price. 
The top 5 cars that emerged after sorting the dataset are then outputted to the user.
